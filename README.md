# Connect 6

The game was developed as a result of my programming exam at the end of the semester.
On the one hand, one can play the classic board game as introduced in 2005 at the conference *Advances in Computer Games*.
On the other hand, a *torus* variant of the game has been implemented, which allows results beyond the game board ends.
